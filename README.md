# Command Line Basics

Command to open the Terminal is CTRL + ALT + T

Command to show your user name is **whoami**

I learn to how to navigate into your folders and files that far away using the terminal

I created a directory in home and named it test  and navigated to the test directory and created a file there called text.txt using the touch command and then navigated back to the test directory
